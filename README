SIGSEGV NOTE:

I was getting segmentation faults (one one of 4 test boxen) on
t/19_freeze_thaw.t ... Turns out, it was my perl version.  5.8.0 was just
that buggy.


GD NOTE: 

I now include GD/GD::Image in the PREREQ_PM.  I didn't want to have to do
it, since it's difficult to install and very little of this package needs
it.  But I did it...  

If you want to skip GD, you can apply this patch:

    patch < newk_GD.patch && perl Makefile.PL

If you still can't get it, email me...


Parse::Lex NOTE:

If you are having trouble with Parse::Lex, then know that you are not
alone.  It seemed to compile on my devel computer, but NOWHERE else. :)

There is a ParseLex-2.15.patch including in this distro.  Try it.


BOTTOM LINE:

Oh, great... yet another SGF parser?

1) Yeah.  Well, Games::Go::SGF didn't really do what I want.  
2) sgf2misc is *gasp* closed source (mostly)
3) I wanted to learn SGF
4) Parse::Lex is neat
5) This one uses GD (well, will use)!
6) This one produces data that you can use in your own programs!
   as_perl() and node_list() returns cool perl structures that
   you can use in your own programs.  I don't think I could have
   done this stuff with the obvious choice, Games::Go::SGF.

I'm tired of enumerating.  Basically, this module reads in SGFs
and produces useable output in dozens (2 so far) of formats.


Later:

I really wanted to use a Grammer with the Lexer.  Turns out,
Games::Go::SGF uses a grammer with Parse::RecDescent.  Suddenly I
begin to wonder why I didn't just use that module afterall.  Heh.  

I am now aware, that I have re-invented the wheel.  *sigh*

Oh well!  Have fun!
