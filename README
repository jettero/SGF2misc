This module was intended to be a flexible and pluggable arch for
parsing SGF and producing images and xml and things.  In reality
it's a bit of a mess.  It may work for certain things and I have
it deployed in quite a few places, but it's probably not the best
choice if you can find something else that works.

As far as I know, I'm the only person left in the whole wide
world that's using this -- the other project originators have
moved on to ruby -- if you use this, and happen to read this,
definitely let me know.
