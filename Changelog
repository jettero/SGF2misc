   - I hope CPAN thinkgs 0.9780>0.9.7.i

0.9.7.i: Thu Jun 03 2010
   - I really haven't worked on this project for a while.  Resurrecting it.
   - There are problem better choices for SGF parsing on CPAN, but I have
     this deployed in a lot of places, so it's worth it to keep it working
     for me.  The largest part of the renewed interest is the fact that
     Parse::Lex installs/tests correctly now.

    To let us parse IGS SGFs out of the box, I made CoPyright[blather blather] equiv to FF[4]... *sigh*

    I found a bug in the ref copy routine -- that omits comments from nodes returned by as_perl()!

    The Many Faces of Go seems to generate SGFs that SGF2misc can't handle!
    I'm working on it.  MFoG uses [tt] pass format.  Arguably, this is wrong, 
    but according to the specs it's legal in FF[4].   So added.
