    To let us parse IGS SGFs out of the box, I made CoPyright[blather blather] equiv to FF[4]... *sigh*

    I found a bug in the ref copy routine -- that omits comments from nodes returned by as_perl()!

    The Many Faces of Go seems to generate SGFs that SGF2misc can't handle!
    I'm working on it.  MFoG uses [tt] pass format.  Arguably, this is wrong, 
    but according to the specs it's legal in FF[4].   So added.
